Hi Jason,
 
We need to speed up the use of the probe so we are going to eliminate some of the switch operations.
 
Here are the following changes:
 
1.       Start/Stop switch operation:
¡¤         Remove the 2 second delay
¡¤         Start the measurement or treatment mode with only 1 operation of the pushbutton switch
¡¤         Pause action in treatment mode is still 1 button push but starting the treatment mode after pausing is just 1 push ¨C no 2 second delay.
 
2.       Measurement Mode:
¡¤         Remove 5 second time display ¨C leave the time display as all 0¡¯s
¡¤         Remove beeping for 5 seconds
¡¤         Remove the 5 second countdown
¡¤         Remove the laser on red indicator(keep for the treatment mode)
¡¤         Start the measurement as soon as the button is pressed
¡¤         Beep as soon as the measurement is finished
 
3.       Treatment Mode:
¡¤         No change except that it starts or pauses with 1 operation of the start/stop switch.
 
Can you get the modified firmware to us by Thursday so we can test it?
